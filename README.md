# Olympics Analysis
As someone who loves sports and data, nothing speaks to a perfect marriage of my two passions than looking into data on the Olympics. The motivation behind this project was to use data to answer a series of questions surrounding the Olympic games from 1896 to 2016.

## Research Questions:
* What is the athlete participation rate at the Olympic Games in the past 120 years?
  * How did the athlete participation rate differ from Summer and Winter games?
* What countries came up on top in the Olympic Games?
  * Which countries had the most gold medals?
  * Which countries had the most silver medals?
  * Which countries had the most bronze medals?
* Who are the top female and male athletes of all time?
* What were the average height, weight, and age of female athletes by sport (from 1960 to 2016)?
* What were the average height, weight, and age of male athletes by sport (from 1960 to 2016)?
